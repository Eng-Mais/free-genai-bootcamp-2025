## Requirements 
Hardware:
- Powerful servers (CPU, RAM, SSD), multiple GPUs, high-bandwidth networking.
- Servers/cloud instances (CPU, RAM, network), GPUs (optional), load balancers.
- The company would like to invest in an on premise & cloud solution (hybrid)

Software: 
- Arabic text understanding (NLU), generation (NLG), and dialogue management.
- Dialect support, morphological analysis, diacritization handling, and Arabic grammar.


## Data Strategy

Our data strategy will focus on:
- Diverse Datasets: Utilizing a wide range of Arabic text and speech data, including various dialects and sources, to train robust and accurate models.
- Data Quality: Implementing rigorous data cleaning and validation processes to ensure high-quality training data.
- Privacy and Security: Adhering to strict data privacy and security protocols to protect user data and comply with regulations.


## Assumptions

- We assume a significant and growing demand for Arabic language AI solutions. Market research will validate this assumption.
- We assume access to sufficient quantities of high-quality Arabic language data. Data acquisition strategies will be developed to address potential limitations.
- We assume the technical feasibility of developing and deploying a high-performing Arabic language AI assistant. Ongoing research and development will mitigate potential technical challenges.

## Considerations 

- Choosing the right model architecture is crucial. For Arabic NLP, transformer-based models like BERT, AraBERT, or GPT are often preferred due to their strong performance.
- Choosing a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure) depends on factors like cost and available services so we will evaluate the specific AI/ML services offered by each provider.
